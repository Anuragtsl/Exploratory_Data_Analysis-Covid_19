# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Covid_19

I have done Data Analysis on Covid-19 dataset.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like Plotly, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc for analysis.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

Download datasets from Covid-19.rar file!

In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Following the call from the WHO to immediately assess available data to learn what care approaches are most effective and evaluate the effects of therapies, this collection aims to report on original peer-reviewed research articles in methodological approaches to medical research related to COVID-19.

You can follow along the Jupyter Notebook for more!
